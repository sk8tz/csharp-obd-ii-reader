U know the prob, your engine runs not normal, but you dont want to go to the workshop cuz they want over $9000 to check your car.

here is the solution, the open source error checker, all u need is an OBDII cable with the ELM-327 Chipset ($15 on ebay).


NOTE: theres no uploaded code at the moment, first upload will be done when the program reaches alpha status
